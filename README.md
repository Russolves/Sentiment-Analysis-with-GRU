# Sentiment-Analysis-with-GRU
This repository contains three variants of a Sentiment Analysis model that uses a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) to predict the sentiment of a given text as either positive or negative. The models were built using PyTorch, and the training and testing data came from DLStudio

The three variants included are:
- customGRU
- torch.nn.GRU
- Bidirectional GRU
